年轻时，我认为旅行是人生重要的事情。但是现在，我意识到旅行不是如此。它没有那么让人兴奋，也算不上成就，跟其他的消费行为没有太大区别。
旅行中，我们真正感兴趣的东西，都是那些留在原地、努力建设的人们创造出来的。

[阮一峰周刊](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2019/06/weekly-issue-62.html) 

When I was younger I thought travel was important to me. But after doing it a bit, I've realized travel isn't what I thought it was. It isn't that exciting and it's not some kind of achievement, other than the achievement of having enough disposable income to make it happen. The people who create things worth visiting--whether that's art or food or buildings or whatever--are people staying where they are and investing in their communities. I want to be one of those people, not the rich jerks taking up space and contributing nothing to the scene.

名流已成为世俗社会的中流砥柱，娱乐崇拜既掩盖了现代生活的空虚，也增强了商品文化的魅力。

人生有两天是特别重要的，一天是自己的诞生，另外一天是知道自己为了什么而活。
